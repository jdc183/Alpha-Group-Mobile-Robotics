// This node should use functions from the traj_builder
// library (Part4/traj_builder) to construct triangular and 
// trapezoidal trajectory plans for either forward travel or 
// spin-in-place motions.  It should receive a goal pose as a 
// service request.  It should attempt to stream sequential 
// desired states in accordance with the request, resulting in
// returning either success or failure.  Reasons for failure 
// would include: encountering a lidar_alarm prior to reaching
// the goal pose, and failure to converge on the goal pose 
// within some tolerance.  In response to a lidar_alarm, this 
// service should dynamically construct and publish (stream) a
// graceful braking trajectory.

// The des_state_publisher should include a “mode” code for 
// spin-in-place, forward-travel, or halt (at specified final 
// state).
