// This node should contain a plan for a sequence of path 
// vertices, and send these as requests one at a timeto the
// des_state_publisher_service.  The coordinator will suspend
// while waiting for a response from the
// des_state_publisher_service.  If the response is “false”, 
// the coordinator should pause briefly, then re-send the 
// last, unsuccessful goal vertex.  (This could be adequate if
// a pedestrian blocks the robot, then subsequently walks away). 
// The navigation_coordinator will grow in sophistication to 
// incorporate path planning and path replanning 
// (e.g. to circumvent unexpected obstacles).
